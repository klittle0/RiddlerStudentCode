| Aug 23 |  5-5:30pm   |                                         I tried to work out code #4, I tried to manually decode the message, assigning each emoji to a letter, but I had no luck. |
| Aug 27 | 3:30-4:00pm |                                                                                     I implemented solutions to puzzles 1-3 using the logic we worked out in class |
| Aug 27 | 4:00-4:30pm | I continued trying to decode #4, looking at different Unicode and decimal conversions, but I couldn't figure out how to convert unicode for an emoji into letters |
| Aug 30 | 6:30-7:00am |                                                                      Using Mr. Blick's tips about unicode & a caesar shift, I implemented a solution to puzzle #4 |
